| `output-folder` | `str` | results | Folder where results and checkpoints will be saved |
| `checkpoint-folder` | `str` | None | Folder where checkpoints will be saved/loaded. If it is not provided, the output folder will be used |
| `evaluation-type` | [`EvaluationType`](../../enums/evaluation_type.py) | None | What type of evaluations should be performed |
| `output-eval-format` | [`OutputFormat`](../../enums/output_format.py) | None | What the format of the output after evaluation will be |

| `metric-types` | [`MetricType`](../../enums/metric_type.py) | JaccardSimilarity | What metrics should be calculated |

| `train-dataset-limit-size` | `int` | None | Limit the train dataset |
| `validation-dataset-limit-size` | `int` | None | Limit the validation dataset |
| `skip-validation` | `bool` | False | Whether validation should be skipped, meaning no validation dataset is loaded and no evaluation is done while training |
| `run-experiments` | `bool` | False | Whether to run experiments instead of training or evaluation |
| `experiment-types` | [`ExperimentType`](../../enums/experiment_type.py) | None | What types of experiments should be run |
| `reset-training-on-early-stop` | `bool` | False | Whether resetting of training should be done if early stopping is activated and the first epoch has not yet been finished |
| `resets-limit` | `int` | 1 | How many times should the training be reset during first epoch if early stopping is activated |
| `training-reset-epoch-limit` | `int` | 1 | Until which epoch the training reset should be performed |
| `save-checkpoint-on-crash` | `bool` | False | If this is set to true, then in the event of an exception or crash of the program, the model's checkpoint will be saved to the file system |
| `save-checkpoint-on-finish` | `bool` | False | If this is set to true, then when the model has converged, its checkpoint will be saved to the file system. Keep in mind that this will not be the best model checkpoint as the stopping will occur after some amount of iterations without any improvement |
Additionally, the following arguments infer from [`PretrainedArgumentsService`](../../services/arguments/pretrained_arguments_service.py) and are used currently in all implemented challenge argument services
